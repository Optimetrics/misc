This repository is a collection of misc small code projects. Some I created and some I found or modified from elsewhere. Either way it's not really worth having a repository for each one.

I collected them all here so I don't lose them, and so others can find and use them easily. I'll be adding more junk here as time passes. If you like weird odds and sodds then check back.
